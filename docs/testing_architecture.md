# Testing Architecture

## Overview

The Error Management System employs a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure reliability and performance.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)

- Component-level testing
- Function validation
- Error handling verification
- State management checks

### 2. Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)

- Component interaction testing
- Data flow validation
- API endpoint testing
- Database integration testing

### 3. End-to-End Tests

- User workflow validation
- System performance testing
- Error recovery testing
- Security testing

## Testing Tools

- pytest: Test execution and reporting
- black: Code formatting
- flake8: Code linting
- isort: Import sorting

## Continuous Testing

- Pre-commit hooks
- Automated test runs
- Coverage reporting
- Performance benchmarking

## Test Data Management
