# Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure

## 2.1 Unit Tests
- [x] Memory management tests
  - [x] Resource monitoring
  - [x] Threshold management
  - [x] Usage metrics
- [x] Error management tests
  - [x] Error lifecycle
  - [x] Memory threshold integration
  - [x] Security validation

## 2.2 Integration Tests
- [ ] System integration tests
  - [ ] End-to-end error handling
  - [ ] Memory management integration
  - [ ] Security system integration
  - [ ] Dashboard integration
  - [ ] API endpoint testing
  - [ ] Database integration

## 2.3 Performance Tests
- [ ] Memory usage benchmarks
  - [ ] Base memory usage
  - [ ] Peak memory usage
  - [ ] Memory leak detection
  - [ ] Garbage collection efficiency
- [ ] Response time measurements
  - [ ] Error detection latency
  - [ ] Fix application timing
  - [ ] API response times
  - [ ] Dashboard performance
- [ ] Token usage optimization
  - [ ] Token consumption tracking
  - [ ] Usage patterns analysis
  - [ ] Optimization strategies
- [ ] System scalability tests
  - [ ] Load testing
  - [ ] Stress testing
  - [ ] Recovery testing

## 2.4 Test Coverage Goals
- [ ] Overall system coverage: 80%
- [ ] Critical components coverage: 90%
- [ ] API endpoint coverage: 100%
- [ ] Error handling coverage: 100%

## 2.5 Testing Tools
- [x] pytest for unit testing
- [x] pytest-asyncio for async testing
- [x] pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- [ ] locust for load testing
- [ ] memory_profiler for memory analysis

## 2.6 Testing Environment
- [x] Local development environment
- [ ] Staging environment
- [ ] Production-like test environment
- [ ] CI/CD test environment

## Status: IN PROGRESS
- Unit tests are complete and passing
- Integration tests need to be implemented
- Performance testing framework needs to be set up
- Coverage goals not yet met

## Next Steps
1. Implement remaining integration tests
2. Set up performance testing infrastructure
3. Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
4. Create test data generation scripts
5. Implement load testing scenarios

## Success Criteria
1. All unit tests passing
2. Integration tests covering all major workflows
3. Performance tests validating system requirements
4. Meeting coverage goals for all components
5. Automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline
